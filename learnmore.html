        <p11>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The words hadn't flowed from his fingers for the past few weeks. He never imagined
            he'd find
            himself with
            writer's block, but here he sat with a blank screen in front of him. That blank screen taunting him day
            after day had started to play with his mind. He didn't understand why he couldn't even type a single word,
            just one to begin the process and build from there. And yet, he already knew that the eight hours he was
            prepared to sit in front of his computer today would end with the screen remaining blank.</br></br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What is the best way to get what you want?" she asked. He looked down at the ground
            knowing that she
            wouldn't like his answer. He hesitated, knowing that the truth would only hurt. How was he going to tell her
            that the best way for him to get what he wanted was to leave her? MaryLou wore the tiara with pride. There
            was something that made doing anything she didn't really want to do a bit easier when she wore it. She
            really didn't care what those staring through the window were thinking as she vacuumed her apartment.

        <p12>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pink ponies and purple giraffes roamed the field. Cotton candy grew from the ground
            as a
            chocolate river meandered off to the side.</p12>
        <p13>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Colors bounced around in her head. They mixed and threaded themselves together.
            Even colors that had no business being together. They were all one, yet distinctly separate at the same
            time. How was she going to explain this to the others?A long black shadow slid across the pavement near
            their feet and the five Venusians, very much startled, looked overhead. They were barely in time to see the
            huge gray form of the carnivore before it vanished behind a sign atop a nearby building which bore the
            mystifying information "Pepsi-Cola."</br></br>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a question of which of the two she preferred. On the one hand, the choice
            seemed simple. The more expensive one with a brand name would be the choice of most. It was the easy choice.
            The safe choice. But she wasn't sure she actually preferred it.Elit ennui adipisicing hot chicken occaecat

                There once lived an old man and an old woman who were peasants and had to work hard to earn their daily
